Contains my solutions for the programming lab assignments of the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?action=enroll&utm_campaign=social-andrew-linkedin-mls-launch-2022&utm_medium=institutions&utm_source=deeplearning-ai) course from Coursera, by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/). 

**NOTE:** The first four optional labs from week 1, course 1 of this specialization are not showcased.

## Prerequesites
* Python 3 (recommended v3.6 or above)
* Jupyter Notebook ([Download and install Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install))

## Usage
Explore the course materials and run Python3 in the Jupyter notebook files (```.ipynb```). In case you're not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, here's a [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) that might help.
